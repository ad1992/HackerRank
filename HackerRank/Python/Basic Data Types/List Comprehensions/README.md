Problem Statement

Lets learn about list comprehensions!. You are given three integers X, Y and Z denoting the dimensions of a Cuboid. You have to print a list of all possible coordinates on the three dimensional grid, such that at any point the sum Xi + Yi + Zi is not equal to N. If X = 2, then possible values of Xi can be 0, 1 and 2. The same applies to Y and Z.

Input Format

Four integers X, Y, Z and N in four different lines.

Output Format

You have to print the list, in increasing order.
